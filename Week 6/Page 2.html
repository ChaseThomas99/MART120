        <h1>The Dumbest Kid in the World</h1>

        <p>A young boy enters a barber shop and the barber whispers to his customer, "This is the dumbest kid in the world. Watch while I prove it to you."</p>
        
        <p>The barber puts a dollar bill in one hand and two quarters in the other, then calls the boy over and asks, "Which do you want, son?" The boy takes the quarters and leaves.</p>
        
        <p>"What did I tell you?" said the barber. "That kid never learns!"</p>
        
        <p>Later, when the customer leaves, he sees the same young boy coming out of an ice cream store.</p>
        
        <p>"Hey, son! May I ask you a question? Why did you take the quarters instead of the dollar bill?"</p>
        
        <p>The boy licked his ice cream and replied, "Because the day I take the dollar, the game is over!"</p>
